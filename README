inflateTT (GPL v2) and deflateTT (GPL v2) are commandline tools that you can use to compress/decompress
data. Used in e.g., Explosion of an Aeroplane to compress graphics data.

inflateTT-DS (LGPL v2.1) contains decompression function inflate(), and is finetuned to work on the Nintendo DS.
inflateTT-MP (LGPL v2.1) is the multiplatform version of inflateTT, meant to be integrated everywhere else.

These implement the compression/decompression specified in RFC-1951.
