1. DESCRIPTION

deflateTT is yet another commandline compressor that implements
the deflate compression for deflate (RFC-1951). It's not done 100%
according to the speficication, i.e. the header part is not like in the
standard, but that shouldn't matter too much.

The motivation behind writing this tool was to get a simple and
efficient data compression utility that didn't depend on any libraries,
like the pretty big and messy zlib, to my Nintendo DS homebrew projects.
inflateTT is the decompression tool that can be used to decompress the
files that have been compressed using deflateTT.

See also the stand-alone project inflateTT-DS for a modified version of
inflateTT that you can integrate to your Nintendo DS homebrew projects
without a hassle.

3. VERSION HISTORY

v1.21 (25-Feb-2010)
  * Thanks to Carl Ådahl for a bug fix. deflateTT would sometimes
    read past the end of 'data' buffer.

v1.2 (06-May-2007)
  * Some files would generate too big Huffman trees, and they would
    choke the compressor.
  * Added support for RLE compression in Huffman code length
    encoding.
  * The number of bits we need to store the raw code lengths is
    now dynamic.

v1.1 (21-Apr-2007)
  * LZ77 preprocessing now uses tables instead of lots of
    elseifs.
  * The Huffman codes aren't written into the compressed
    files, making this more RFC-1951 compatible.
  * The code lengths are now RLE+Huffman compressed, like
    RFC-1951 says.

v1.0 (27-Jan-2007)
  * The first public release
