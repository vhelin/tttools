1. DESCRIPTION

inflateTT is yet another commandline decompressor that implements
the inflate decompression for deflate (RFC-1951). It's not done 100%
according to the speficication, i.e. the header part is not like in the
standard, but that shouldn't matter too much.

The motivation behind writing this tool was to get a simple and
efficient data compression utility that didn't depend on any libraries,
like the pretty big and messy zlib, to my Nintendo DS homebrew projects.
deflateTT is the compression tool that outputs files that can be
decompressed using inflateTT.

See also the stand-alone project inflateTT-DS for a modified version of
inflateTT that you can integrate to your Nintendo DS homebrew projects
without a hassle.

  * Added support for deflateTT v1.2 (DEFc) files.

v1.1 (21-Apr-2007)
  * The Huffman codes aren't read from the compressed files,
    but generated from the code lengths making this more

    RFC-1951 says.
