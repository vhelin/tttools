1. DESCRIPTION

inflateTT-MP is yet another decompressor that implements the inflate
decompression for deflate (RFC-1951). It's not done 100% according to
the speficication, i.e. the header part is not like in the standard,
but that shouldn't matter too much.

The motivation behind writing this piece of code was to get a simple and
efficient data compression utility that didn't depend on any libraries,
like the pretty big and messy zlib, to my homebrew projects.
deflateTT is the compression tool that outputs files that can be
decompressed using inflateTT-MP.

Integrate inflate.c to your homebrew (or some other) project, and use
inflate() to decompress deflateTT'ed data.

inflateTT-MP is the multiplatform version of inflateTT. Where
inflateTT-DS is written Nintendo DS in mind, MP should cover all
other platforms.

3. VERSION HISTORY

v1.3 (25-Nov-2007)
  * The header file is now C++ compatible.
  * Added return values to inflate().
  * Encapsulated all the variables inflate() require into an inflateContext
    structure thus making inflate() thread safe.

v1.2 (06-May-2007)
  * Added support for deflateTT v1.2 (DEFc) files.

v1.1 (21-Apr-2007)
  * The Huffman codes aren't read from the compressed files,
    but generated from the code lengths making this more
    RFC-1951 compatible.

v1.0 (27-Jan-2007)
  * The first public release
