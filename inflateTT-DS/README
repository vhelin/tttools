1. DESCRIPTION

inflateTT-DS is yet another decompressor that implements the inflate
decompression for deflate (RFC-1951). It's not done 100% according to
the speficication, i.e. the header part is not like in the standard,
but that shouldn't matter too much.

The motivation behind writing this piece of code was to get a simple and
efficient data compression utility that didn't depend on any libraries,
like the pretty big and messy zlib, to my Nintendo DS homebrew projects.
deflateTT is the compression tool that outputs files that can be
decompressed using inflateTT-DS.

Integrate inflate.c to your Nintendo DS (or some other) project, and
use inflate() to decompress deflateTT'ed data. Does 16bit writes to
output, so inflate() can be used to decompress data directly into
e.g., the VRAM of Nintendo DS.
